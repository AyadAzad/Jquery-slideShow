# Small-project-using-Jquery-

in this project you will see an image slider, it was created by using HTML, CSS, and Jquery.
It looks simple, but it has a good functionality, and I was a good practice to learn something new about Jquery.

nowdays, Jquery is not used too much because of having JavaScript frameworks like , React, Angular, and Vue.
